# azure-resume
This is my [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/) built on Azure. It's a static portfolio website hosted on Azure storage, with a visitor counter built on Azure Functions. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visitor counter is built with .NET and Azure Functions

## Frontend

I used this [Template](https://styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/) to create my site.
- **frontend/**: Folder contains the website.
    - **main.js**: Folder Contains visitor counter code.

The visitor counter data is fetched via an API call to an Azure Function.
